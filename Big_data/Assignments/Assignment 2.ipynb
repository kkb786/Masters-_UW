For this assignment, you will need the same text file (`Shakespeare.txt`) and Python tokenizer module, `simple_tokenize.py`, that you used for the first two assignments.    You will also use the same definition of PMI that was used for [Assignment 1](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs451/assignment1-431.html).\n",

Before going on, execute that code (by selecting the cell and hitting 'return' while holding down the shift key).   It will take a few seconds to run, and will produce no output."

    "Spark is involved with calculating the quantity count. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a range function creates an array of integers taking values from 0 to (num_samples-1). Then this array is parallelized (converterd to an RDD), i.e. it allows the spark to distribute the array across multiple nodes using the function \"sc.parallelize\". After converting the array into an RDD, a filter is applied on this RDD, where the function defined earlier is used. This function takes a dummy input that is the member of the RDD, and generates two random numbers uniformly from between the interval [0,1], and checks if the sum of squares of these two numbers is less than 1 or not. If it is smaller than 1 than the filter keeps the value from RDD, otherwise it discards it. After completing the implementation of this filter, we have a new RDD, and the function \".count()\" is applied on it to see how many elements does it have. and finally, this number is the value for the variable count, that we referred earlier."

    "Finally, write Spark code for the function `PMI_one_token`, that will take a positive integer threshold $T$ and a sample size $N$ as arguments. For every token $x$ in `Shakespeare.txt`, your code should find all tokens $y$ that co-occur with $x$ at least $T$ times, as well as PMI$(x,y)$ for each such pair, the co-occurrence count of the pair, the number of times $x$ appears, and the number of times $y$ appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $x$, the output of your program should be equivalent to the output that would be produced by a One-Token query on $x$ (see Assignment 1), with threshold $T$. Rather than producing output for all possible tokens $x$, the function should produce output only for $N$ different $x$'s, chosen at random from among all distinct tokens in the input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your solution for question 6 by implementing the function `PMI_one_token` in the code cell below. It should use the `SparkContext` which was created previously (referenced by the variable `sc`). The function `PMI_one_token` should return a list of $N$ tuples of the form `(token, [ list_of_cooccurring_tokens ])`, where each entry in `list_of_cooccurring_tokens` is of the form `((token1, token2), pmi, cooc_count, token1_count, token2_count)`.\n",
