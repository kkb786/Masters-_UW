    "#### Overview\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to perform some graph analysis, using a graph of the Gnutella server network.   In this graph, each node represents a server, and each (directed) edge represents a connection between servers in Gnutella's peer-to-peer network.  The input file for this assignment, `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt`, represents the graph as an adjacency list.   Each server (node) is identified by a unique number, and each line in the file gives the adjacency list for a single server.\n",
    "For example, this line:\n",
    "> 91\t243\t1923\t2194\n",
    "\n",
    "gives the adjacency list for server `91`.   It indicates that there are edges from server `91` to servers `243`, `1923`, and `2194`.    According to the Stanford Network Analysis Project, which collected these data, [the graph includes 6301 servers and 20777 edges](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html).\n",

All necessary code should be included in the function body (except for import statements). You may declare functions inside of the function body. When marking, we will execute your code by calling the functions from an external program, which is why your code cannot rely on statements running outside functions.

    "- One node in the graph is designated as the *source* node. Personalized page rank is performed with respect to that source node.\n",
    "- Personalized page rank is initialized by assigning all probability mass to the source node, and none to the other nodes. In contrast, ordinary page rank is initialized by giving all nodes the same probability mass.\n",

For each of the 10 nodes, return the node's id and page rank value as a tuple. The list returned by the function should therefore look something like this: `[(node_id_1, highest_pagerank_value), ..., (node_id_10, 10th_highest_pagerank_value)]`"

    "Spark provides the ability to *cache* RDDs.   This is useful when an RDD will be used more than once.   Instead of computing the same RDD multiple times, it can be computed once, cached, and then re-used from the cache.   Read about caching in the Spark textbook, or in the [persistence section of the Spark RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence).   Caching can be particularly effective for iterative Spark applications, like those you are writing for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, go back to the code that you wrote to answer Question 3, and add caching.   (Caching will not affect the functionality of your code, i.e., what it computes.   It should only affect performance.)   Don't worry about different persistence levels.   Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to adding `cache()` calls in your code, use the text cell below to briefly explain how you decided which RDDs to cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were not able to finish Question 3, add caching annotations to your solution for Question 2 instead."

    "*In my code the two rdds that are being reused are named as original and orig. Now, ideally we will cache these rdds outside the function, as for any function call, we are using the same rdd. But as I have been losing marks in the previous assignment for doing any operations outside the function, I would rather be safe than sorry.\n",
    "So the way I cache the rdd in the function is first check if the original rdd already exists, if not, than create it and cache() it, similar with orig rdd. Since all other rdds are being updated in each iterations, then it would not make sense to cache any of those files.*\n",
