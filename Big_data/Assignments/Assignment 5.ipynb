    "#### Overview\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to perform spam detection.   You will need to perform two tasks.   The first is to build spam prediction models, using training data sets and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).   The second is to use these models to predict whether the documents in a test data set are spam.\n",
    "The stochastic gradient descent technique that you will be using is based on [a paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5168) by Cormack, Smucker and Clarke.\n",

    "#### Training a Spam Classification Models\n",
    "To build a spam classification model, you will start with a training data set.   Each instance in the training set represents a single document, and is labeled to indicate whether that document should be considered to be spam or ham.\n",
    "An instance looks like this:\n",

    "clueweb09-en0094-20-13546 spam 387908 697162 426572 161118 688171 ...\n",

The second field is the label, indicating whether the document should be considered spam (as in this example) or ham.   The remaining fields are integers representing *features* present in the document.   In this case, the features are hashed byte 4-grams, represented as integers.   Each training data set is stored as a text file, with one instance per line.   The training files have been preloaded into the directory `/u/cs451/public_html/spam` for you.   They are:\n",

    "#### Question 1 ( 5/20 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to write a sequential SGD model trainer in Python (no Spark).   For our purposes, a model associates a *weight* with each feature.   The model trainer decides what these weights should be, based on the training instances.  Since you are going to be writing a model trainer based on SGD, the trainer should behave like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for each training instance T\n",
    "   predict whether T is spam or ham using the weights of the current model\n",
    "   update the model weights by comparing T's predicted label with its actual label\n",
    "```\n",
    "Of course, the important part is how to update the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [the paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5168), the model is used to assign a \"spamminess\" score to a document.   Documents with positive spamminess are predicted to be spam.   Those with negative spamminess are predicted to be ham.  The spamminess of a document $D$ is simply the sum of the weights (from the model) of each of the document's features:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "spamminess(D) = \\sum_{f \\in D}{w(f)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $w(f)$ is the weight assocated with feature $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python module `spamminess.py` defines a function `spamminess(F,W)` which computes this quantity.   This function takes two arguments, `F` and `W`.  `F` is a list of features (integers) associated to the document whose spamminess you want to compute, and `W` is a dictionary representing the current model.  `W` maps features ($f$) to their weights ($w(f)$) under the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, you will find partial pseudo-code that shows how to implement the SGD model trainer defined by Cormack, Smucker, and Clarke.   It reads the training instances one at a time from one of the training files, and uses them to adjust the model weights.   Your job is to turn this pseudo-code into actual runnable Python code that can\n",
    "be used to learn a model from any one of the training files. Implement the function `sequential_SGD()` that takes as input a model (`w`), the training dataset and a value for the update parameter `delta`, and returns the trained model."

    "Use Spark's `saveAsTextFile` action to output your model.   For example, if you are training a model for the group_x training set, use `saveAsTextFile(\"models/group_x_model\")`.   This will actually cause Spark to create a folder called `group_x_model`.   In the folder, there will be files with names like `part-00000` that contain the actual output data.  When you use `saveAsTextFile`, Spark will generate one `part-xxxxx` file for each partition of the RDD that you are writing out.   In this case, you should have only a single partition (for the reason described below), so there should be only one `part-xxxxx` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training the SGD model is an inherently sequential task, since the training instances update the model one at a time, and each instance's spamminess is computed using the model produced by that instance's predecessors.   This means that the only part of the training that you can parallelize using Spark is the parsing of the input file.   Once the input is parsed, your Spark implementation will have to force all of the instances into a single partition, and then apply the training function to the entire partition.   To see whether you are getting sensible results, you can compare the model you learn with Spark to the one that you learned with your sequential Python program from Question 1.\n",

You can use it to generate models from all three of the training files, leaving the results in your models folder. For this assignment, you will be using Spark's original RDD interface, rather than the DataFrame interface.\n"

    "\n",
    "Each line in this file represents a document that needs to be classified as spam or ham.  The format of this file is identical to the format of the files that hold the training instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function `spark_classify` below that will load a model (from a specified folder under `models`), classify all of the instances in a given test data file (`spam.test.qrels.txt` by default) using that model, and then output the results in the folder `results_path` using Spark's `saveAsTextFile`.   The contents of the output file should look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(clueweb09-en0000-00-00142,spam,2.601624279252943,spam)\n",

    "```\n",
    "Each line of the output represents one test instance.   The first two fields are the document ID and the test label.  These are just copied from the test data.   The third field is the spamminess score of the document, produced by the spamminess function using the model you are classifying with.   The fourth field is the spam/ham prediction made by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, your spam/ham classifier must **not** use the test label from the input when making its prediction.  The test labels are the \"ground truth\" against which your predictions are being compared.   Using them to make predictions would defeat the whole purpose of model-based classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that classification of the test instances is done by Spark, not by your driver program.  Do ***not*** load the test instances or classification results into your driver program. You are however allowed to load the model weights into your driver program to distribute them as side data. \n",
    "Unlike model training, classification is easily parallelizable, since each document is classified independently. "
